Originally storage for a college course, Programming Languages Concepts CS431, that included concepts about Functional (StandardML), Logical (Prolog), and Imperative (Ruby) languages.

Solving the ```./pdfs``` is a great way to learn a language, so I'll continue adding to this repo as I learn new languages.

## In Progress
* Haskell (Functional)

## Completed
* StandardML (Functional)
* Prolog (Logical)
* Ruby (Imperative)
